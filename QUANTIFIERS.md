Earlier, we found the notions that certain traits of the enriched code (the code
comments, our literate programming comments are the main real-estate here) that
factors in education, previous experience, even cultural differences. Tailor
made educational services are costful and impractical. Luckily internet has
improved some circumstances but digital learning will probably not work for
everyone, just as much as not just anyone can easily become a programmer.

Although I believe anything to be possible, it's safe to assume that atleast
some people are more likely to follow down a certain path of personal growth and
development, learning and education then others. Social background, atleast
since long, has been a very important factor but we see this taken away by low
prices of computers, information on the internet and other developments.

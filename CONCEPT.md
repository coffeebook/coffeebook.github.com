# Coffeebook

*brings you the entire story from beginning to end*

What is it?
-----------

Coffeebook is a [Literate CoffeeScript][lcs] and [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]
(GFM) enabled programming Documentation as a Service adventure.

Oh dear. Another startup?
-------------------------

Well yes and no. Fist and foremost, this idea follows naturally on a path I have
taken down the world of computer programming. Recently I have quit my job as a
civil servant and this way is one of my outlets to shape ideas and perhaps, make
a living out of it some day.

Some day?
---------

Rather sooner than later, since I am still employed currently but soon enough
will have to run my own IT freelance operation. I do get a lot of support from
designer/coder/teacher/trainer friends on subjects that involve easthetic
aspects and matters of (electronic) learning. I myself am autodidactic,
which might partially explain my favorism of the LP style of programming.

Auto-what?
-----------

An autodidact, or at least according to [Wikipedia][wp1], is:

> Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning that is related
to but different from informal learning. In a sense, autodidacticism is
"learning on your own" or "by yourself", and an autodidact is a self-teacher.
Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorptive procession. Some autodidacts
spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational
websites.

And when we continue to read, as has happened with me around my 22nd age, we
notice it may happen at varying stages of life that one becomes one:

> One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While
some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they
may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas. Many notable
contributions have been made by autodidacts.

So I should learn to learn things by myself?
--------------------------------------------

No, far from it. Most people need others to learn, even autodidacts obviously,
since the information didn't just appear out of thin air. It is more about the
process of learning, and creative expression and the joy of creating beautiful
things. But in order for most people to learn that, they usually need others to
demonstrate.

We know and understand, that everyone learns at a different rate, pace, speed,
intensity and - of course - has a different level of understanding of the
information being presented. Often, many people need to 'do' things first, but
it helps if you can (in the case of theoretical, complex or abstract
information) can picture that which is being communicated (the message).

Isn't this just a tutorial then?
--------------------------------

Demonstration is one thing. You'll find enough from most web sites who have 'top
XYZ' collections of jQuery effects and widgets. But their is one other, in my
view largely unexplored, territory of that other part: explanation, the context,
and backgrounds not only the the *what* and *how* but also the *why* or why not.



Few people can write a good tutorial, and in my book that is one which is
balanced in just the right amount of information it provides on the mechanics,
as well as the reasoning and science behind it.

It's not a new idea. The great Dr. Donald Knuth has written about the subject of
[literate programming][lp] before:

> The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose
main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with
thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what
each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible
because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human
understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce
each other.

And a few languages have a special 'mode' for literate programming, not only CoffeeScript




* We take a small snippet of code;
* either by itself as stand-alone or as part of a larger code base;
* we explain _why_ it works;
* we explain _how_ it works by itself;
* or in _relation with others_;
* we show you what your options are;
* and you decide how the story continues.




How will you fund it?
---------------------


The idea is that I pay for costs by providing paid services of literate
programming nature. In essence, the site is free to use at a basic level.
Forever. I hate 30 days and especially when I feel every inch of it was growth-
hacked and money-motivated to convert A/B groups. To me, this borders 'evil'
much like supermarkets matching up unconciously outspoken messages specifically
for males (because they are the more impulsive buyers) or for children (next to
checkout there is always candy). I'm not saying it's evil evil, or evil, just
bordering evil. Now that we've got money and bad mojo out of the way, and I
would hope to be able to make a decent honest living which I don't mind to be
above average, much more do I find great value in 'bettering the world', as per
twofold personality traits of my people: the merchant and the preacher man
(Dutch).

Anyway more on [funding][euro] and [motivation][why] here.
